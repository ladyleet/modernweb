Ben Lesh and Tracy Lee interview Zabriskies Beard and Jamison Dance on the accidental creation of React Rally, how the JavaScript framework communities are organically formed based on the strength of the frameworks opinions and exploration into why the react community exists in the form that it does. Also discussed are Power Rangers fighting bananas at React Rally, how redux is pushing the envelope for react developers to solve harder problems, and discussing the possibilities of a future react cli.
