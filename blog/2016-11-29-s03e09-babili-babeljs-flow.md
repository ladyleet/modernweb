We interview Henry Zhu (@left_pad) on babels new minifier - babili. Babili is a minifier based on the babel toolchain. They discuss how babili might minify bananas and power rangers, the babel plugin - emojification, how Sebastian McKenzie once blocked Jay Phelps on twitter, why babili is important for the JS ecosystem, flow and using babel with flow, contributing to interesting open source projects, bit manipulation languages, and TrumpScript.
