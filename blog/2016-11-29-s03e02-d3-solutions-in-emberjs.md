Ivan Vanderbyl (Co-Founder, flood.io) and Taras Mankovski (Founder, EmberSherpa), 2 Ember developers have a discussion around D3 in Ember and the solutions they have been working on to make graphing easier with the framework using add-ons. Ivan and Taras have been working on separate D3 ember solutions - ember-d3-helpers and maximum plaid. This podcast illustrates how separate projects solving the same problems in a community can converge and move towards a common solution. Discussion revolves around using composable helpers and creating solutions on an atomic level that can be used to solve problems across various unrelated matters.
