Welcome to the Jeff Cross Show on Modern Web! Jafar Husain of Netflix tells us why Angular 2 is the greatest framework ever, then gets put through the ringer with code questions from Jeff Cross. He also speaks about the history of ReactiveX, gives his opinion on observers and promises, and jams on the state of functional programing exploding in the javascript community.
