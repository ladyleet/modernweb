Raquel Moss (@raquelxmoss), Kent C. Dodds (@kentcdodds), and Ben Lesh (@benlesh) sit down at React Rally to discuss the conference, what makes for a good presentation, and how to feel comfortable speaking at conferences. Kent shows us how to do air squats before they discuss Raquelâ€™s recent contribution to CycleJS core, beginner contributions to open source, tips on how to think about your first contributions, and the benefits of ReactJS.
