Since Angular 2, the demand for Angular training has increased dramatically. Bill and Zack discuss how Angular 2s use of TypeScript has changed the perspective of JavaScript to .net and java developers and the gratification of teaching JavaScript to new and experienced developers. Bill talks about the contrast between teaching Angular1x and Angular 2, how angular-cli is changing the way developers think about JavaScript, and how the greater whole of the AngularJS teaching community works together to support each other.
