Tracy Lee interviews Ben Lesh at React Rally. They discuss the React community compared to other JavaScript communities, which they boil down to being very similar to a “choose-your-own-adventure”. Important things to note in this podcast: The benefits and costs of new ES2015 features, Node’s position in the JavaScript ecosystem and how TC39 standards are affecting the node ecosystem, senior developers mentoring and making junior developers feel comfortable, the promises spec and cancellation tokens with observables. Other topics: how React trainings differ from Angular or Ember trainings, the new create-react-app and why it’s so amazing, the new screencast site Yolobrolo, and why @godtributes is the most amazing twitter bot ever. Ben also might have said that Dan Abramov is a React superstar, but you’ll have to listen to be sure. Tracy called out Ben on not wearing the hat that Sam Saccone’s mother purchased him.
